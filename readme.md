### my todo
Example from myself

Backbone is like a structured Jquery. 
In Jquery, we detect event from DOM and change data. 

Backbone helps us organize the dom in 'view', we can register events in view. 

Render method in view takes the template, pass object as values, return this for chained functions.

Another kind of view is templated based component. We can CRUD them. 

Backbone use 'model' and 'Collecion' to help with managing the data. We can add 'events' listener for the collections.
